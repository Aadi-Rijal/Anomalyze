# Anomalyze

**Explaining Anomalies and Threats using Isolation Forest and SHAP**

Anomalyze is a machine learning-based tool designed for detecting and explaining anomalies and potential threats in network or system data. It uses custom **Isolation Forest** for unsupervised anomaly detection and custom **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for interpreting the detected anomalies.
